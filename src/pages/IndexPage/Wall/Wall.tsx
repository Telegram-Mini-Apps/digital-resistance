          <p>I've criticized Telegram before for not being serious with encryption.</p>

            But (given the info available so far: the charge seems to be just being
            "unmoderated" and not giving up people's data), this looks very bad and
            worrying for the future of software and comms freedom in Europe.

          out‚Äî

          Pavel Durov left Russia when the government tried to control his social media
          company, Telegram. But in the end, it wasn't Putin who arrested him for
          allowing the public to exercise free speech. It was a western country, a Biden
          administration ally and enthusiastic NATO member, that locked him away. Pavel
          Durov sits in a French jail tonight, a living warning to any platform owner who
          refuses to censor the truth at the behest of governments and intel agencies.
          Darkness is descending fast on the formerly free world.
